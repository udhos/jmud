INTRODUCTION

  JMud is a MUD server written in Java(TM) from scratch. This document
  assumes the reader is familiar with terms like 'server', 'mud' and
  'Java'.

  This is a (Brazilian) Portuguese version. Multi-lingual support is
  under development.

  By now, one should keep in mind that JMud is at early development
  stage; thus it's not pretty useful for those who don't have some
  experience with mud server programming.

  There are lots of information to add to this and to other document
  files. But once JMud still requires many essential MUD
  functionalities, the documentation job probably is going to be
  postponed.


GETTING NEW RELEASES

  The latest releases of JMud can be obtained from:

    http://jmud.sourceforge.net


REQUIREMENTS

  The JMud is a server application written in Java(TM). The good thing
  is that it may be executed in any environment for whose there is a
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The bad thing is that to run it, one
  will typically need two tools:

  The Java Compiler

    The compiler is a program that produces code which the JVM is able
    to run. For such purpose, JMud developers use the Jikes
    installation that comes default with Debian GNU/Linux.

  The Java Interpreter

    The interpreter is a program that implements the JVM. JMud
    developers prefer to use the Kaffe installation that comes default
    with Debian GNU/Linux.

OTHER TOOLS

  Apache Ant is a Java based build tool. In theory it is a kind of
  make without make's wrinkles. That should ease the build process in
  many cases.

  * See links below.

BUILDING

  USING ANT

    Type:
        ant

  WITHOUT ANT

    Type:
	cd src
	jar xvf ../lib/java_cup_runtime.jar
	jikes jmud/JMud.java

  TIP: Old Jikes versions need the switch "-encoding latin1" to
    support non-ascii characters for the Portuguese language.

  
RUNNING

  USING ANT

    Type:
        kaffe -jar dist/jmud*.jar

  WITHOUT ANT

    Move jmud.cfg to src/.
    Move rec/     to src/.

    Type:
        kaffe jmud.JMud


  JMud's logging info is expected to quickly fill up your terminal.

  As soon as you see the message 'Esperando por conexões' (Waiting
  for connections), that means the JMud server is ready.


CLIENTS

  You can use a simple telnet as client. In another prompt, type:
    'telnet <host> <port-number>'

  EXAMPLES

  1) If JMud is running in your machine and listening on the default
     port-number:

    telnet 127.0.0.1 1234

  2) If JMud running in the 'zeus.provedor.com.br' machine:

    telnet zeus.provedor.com.br 1234


HINTS

  * The first user to log into JMud, and only him, may have access to
  super-user privileges by invoking the command: 'moderador'.  Other
  super-users need be named by the first super-user, through the
  'promova' command.

  * Use the 'commandos' command to list all commands that your user
  has access.
